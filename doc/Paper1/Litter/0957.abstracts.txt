   We present evidence for ultraviolet/optical microlensing in the
   gravitationally lensed quasar Q 0957+561. We combine new measurements
   from our optical monitoring campaign at the United States Naval
   Observatory, Flagstaff, with measurements from the literature and find
   that the time-delay-corrected r-band flux ratio m[A] - m[B] has
   increased by ~0.1 mag over a period of five years beginning in the fall
   of 2005. We apply our Monte Carlo microlensing analysis procedure to
   the composite light curves, obtaining a measurement of the optical
   accretion disk size, log {(r[s] /cm)[cos (i)/0.5]^1/2} = 16.2 ± 0.5,
   that is consistent with the quasar accretion disk size-black hole mass
   relation.

   New light curves of the gravitationally lensed double quasar Q0957+561
   in the gr bands during 2008-2010 include densely sampled, sharp
   intrinsic fluctuations with unprecedentedly high signal-to-noise ratio.
   These relatively violent flux variations allow us to very accurately
   measure the g-band and r-band time delays between the two quasar images
   A and B. Using correlation functions, we obtain that the two time
   delays are inconsistent with each other at the 2sigma level, with the
   r-band delay exceeding the 417-day delay in the g band by about 3 days.
   We also studied the long-term evolution of the delay-corrected flux
   ratio B/A from our homogeneous two-band monitoring with the Liverpool
   Robotic Telescope between 2005 and 2010. This ratio B/A slightly
   increases in periods of violent activity, which seems to be correlated
   with the flux level in these periods. The presence of the previously
   reported dense cloud within the cD lensing galaxy, along the line of
   sight to the A image, could account for the observed time delay and
   flux ratio anomalies.

   Title:
   New two-colour light curves of Q0957+561: time delays and the origin of
   intrinsic variations

   Aims: We extend the gr-band time coverage of the gravitationally lensed
   double quasar Q0957+561. New gr light curves permit us to detect
   significant intrinsic fluctuations, to determine new time delays, and
   thus to gain perspective on the mechanism of intrinsic variability in
   Q0957+561.
   Methods: We use new optical frames of Q0957+561 in the g and r
   passbands from January 2005 to July 2007. These frames are part of an
   ongoing long-term monitoring with the Liverpool robotic telescope. We
   also introduce two photometric pipelines that are applied to the new gr
   frames of Q0957+561. The transformation pipeline incorporates
   zero-point, colour, and inhomogeneity corrections to the instrumental
   magnitudes, so final photometry to the 1-2% level is achieved for both
   quasar components. The two-colour final records are then used to
   measure time delays.
   Results: The gr light curves of Q0957+561 show several prominent events
   and gradients, and some of them (in the g band) lead to a time delay
   between components Delta t[BA] = 417 ± 2 d (1sigma). We do not find
   evidence of extrinsic variability in the light curves of Q0957+561. We
   also explore the possibility of a delay between a large event in the g
   band and the corresponding event in the r band. The gr
   cross-correlation reveals a time lag Delta t[rg] = 4.0 ± 2.0 d (1sigma;
   the g-band event is leading) that confirms a previous claim of the
   existence of a delay between the g and r band in this lensed quasar.
   Conclusions: The time delays (between quasar components and between
   optical bands) from the new records and previous ones in similar bands
   indicate that most observed variations in Q0957+561 (amplitudes of ~100
   mmag and timescales of ~100 d) are very probably due to reverberation
   within the gas disc around the supermassive black hole.

   A Robust Determination of the Time Delay in 0957+561A, B and a

   Continued photometric monitoring of the gravitational lens system
   0957+561A, B in the g and r bands with the Apache Point Observatory
   (APO) 3.5 m telescope during 1996 shows a sharp g-band event in the
   trailing (B) image light curve at the precise time predicted in an
   earlier paper. The prediction was based on the observation of the event
   during 1995 in the leading (A) image and on a differential time delay
   of 415 days. This success confirms the so-called short delay, and the
   absence of any such feature at a delay near 540 days rejects the "long
   delay" for this system, thus resolving a long-standing controversy. A
   series of statistical analyses of our light-curve data yield a best-fit
   delay of 417 +/- 3 days (95% confidence interval) and demonstrate that
   this result is quite robust against variations in the analysis
   technique, data subsamples, and assumed parametric relationship of the
   two light curves. Recent improvements in the modeling of the lens
   system (consisting of a galaxy plus a galaxy cluster) allow us to
   derive a value of the global value (at z = 0.36) of Hubble's constant
   H0 using Refsdal's method, a simple and direct (single-step) distance
   determination based on experimentally verified and securely understood
   physics and geometry. The result is H0 = 64 +/- 13 km s-1 Mpc-1 (for
   Omega = 1), where this 95% confidence interval is dominantly due to
   remaining lens model uncertainties. However, it is reassuring that
   available observations of the lensing mass distribution over-constrain
   the model and thus provide an internal consistency check on its
   validity. We argue that this determination of the extragalactic
   distance scale (10% accurate at 1 sigma ) is now of comparable quality,
   in terms of both statistical and systematic uncertainties, to those
   based on more conventional techniques. Finally, we briefly discuss the
   prospects for improved H0 determinations using gravitational lenses,
   and some other possible implications and uses of the 0957+561A, B light
   curves.

   The time delay of gravitational lens 0957 + 561. I - Methodology and

   A method is reported which was developed for determining the time delay
   between two irregularly sampled data sets, based on an optical
   reconstruction that minimizes a global chi-squared, one which takes
   into account the relative strength of expected correlations of each
   data point with all others. It is concluded from the application of
   this method to published data that previous estimates based on optical
   data of the time delay between components A and B of the gravitational
   lens 0957 + 561 are incorrect: their quoted error bars are vastly
   underestimated. The method is extended and applied to the radio data of
   Lehar et al. (1992). For the radio data alone, the analysis yields the
   result tau-AB = 548 +19/-16 d. Combined analysis of the optical and
   radio data yield tau-AB of 540 +/-12 d.

   The method for determining the time delay of gravitational lens
   0957+561, which we previously applied to published optical data, is
   here extended and applied to the radio data of Lehar et al. The radio
   data are relatively free of the windowing effects of seasonal
   observing. For the radio data alone, our analysis gives the result
   tau[AB] = 548^+19[-16] days (95% C.L.). Combined analysis of the
   optical and radio data yield tau[AB] = 540±12 days (95% C.L.). We have
   also fitted for a linear drift between the two components (possibly an
   indication of microlensing). The radio data are consistent with zero
   drift (as expected theoretically), while the optical data show a small
   but marginally significant drift at the 2.4 sigma level.

   The value of the time delay Delta t(A, B) for the 'double' quasar

   The time delay between images A and B of the supposed
   gravitational-lens double quasar 0957+561 is determined on the basis of
   an extensive photometric monitoring campaign covering the period
   1980-1987. Electronographic, photographic, and photoelectric
   observations in the B band, obtained at the Observatoire de Haute
   Provence, the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, and Calar Alto, are
   combined with published CCD data (Schild, 1986) in extensive tables and
   graphs and analyzed. A travel-time delay of 415 + or - 20 days is
   calculated and shown to be consistent with the gravitational-mirage
   hypothesis. Small slow variations in the true interimage brightness
   ratio at a given emission time are also detected, and the ratio is
   found to be different from that of the extended features seen in radio
   VLBI observations; a possible microlensing effect is inferred.

   Time Delay in QSO 0957+561 From 1984-1999 Optical Data

   Photometric optical data of QSO 0957+561 covering the period 1984-1999
   are analyzed to discern between the two values of the time delay (417
   and 424 days) mostly accepted in the recent literature. The
   observations, performed by groups from three different
   institutions-Princeton University, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
   Astrophysics, and Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias-and including
   new unpublished 1998-1999 data from the IAC80 Telescope, were obtained
   in five filters (V, R, I, g, and r). The different light curves have
   been divided into observational seasons, and two restrictions have been
   applied to calculate the time delay better: (1) points with a strange
   photometric behavior have been removed, and (2) data sets without large
   gaps have been selected. Simulated data were generated to test several
   numerical methods intended to compute the time delay (Deltatau[AB]).
   The methods giving the best results-the discrete correlation function,
   delta^2, z-transformed discrete correlation function, and linear
   interpolation-were then applied to real data. A first analysis of the
   23 different time delays derived from each technique shows that
   Deltatau[AB] must be in the interval 420-424 days. From our statistical
   study, a most probable value of Deltatau[AB]=422.6+/-0.6 days is
   inferred.

   A statistical analysis of an extended data set on a time basis of 17
   years of optical observations of the gravitationally lensed quasar
   0957+561 is presented. We use all available photometry to estimate the
   time delay between A and B images as 416.3+/- 1.7 days. Using this
   refined value we investigate basic statistical properties of the
   difference curve between the A and the time shifted B image. We find a
   significant variability of 0.25 mag on a time scale of 5 years, which
   we interpret as microlensing by compact objects in the lensing galaxy.
